<p> <blockquote cite="https://www.trawell.in/andhra/papikondalu"> original name for this hill range was 'Papidi Kondalu'. Papidi is a rough translation for partition in Telugu. It is believed that the place was visited by Lord Rama and goddess Sita during their exile. Papi Kondalu has to be reached by boat from Rajahmundry, Pattisam (35 km from Rajahmundry), Polavaram (40 km from Rajahmundry), Kunavaram (50 km from Bhadrachalam) or Sriram Giri (60 km from Bhadrachalam). The boat service from Rajahmundry to Bhadrachalam is a wonderful experience and it is operated in post monsoon season.

    Apart from enjoying the view of the hills, valley and waterfalls, tourists can engage in activities like camping and trekking. There are several sights that fall on the way like Perantallapalli, Gandipochamma Temple and Pattiseema. Several tribal communities have made their dwellings on these hills whose main occupation is agriculture, fishing and making handicrafts. There is a waterfall at Munivaatam that is a popular tourist attraction.
    
    The boat rides usually include full-day trips starting from Rajahmundry/ Pattisam / Polavaram / Kunavaram / Sriram Giri with break at Perantallapalli and back. Both AP Tourism and Private operators offer these tours from Rajahmundry. There are also one-way trips between Rajahmundry/ Pattisam/Polavaram and Kunavaram/Sriram Giri.

One has to book the boat and the huts in advance through tourist agencies or AP Tourism.

<h2>4.Sabari</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://www.holidify.com/places/bhadrachalam/sabari-sightseeing-1335.html">Dhammakka, also known as Sabari was a tribal woman and a great devotee of Lord Rama. Overwhelmed with the amount of devotion she had for him, Rama granted her salvation. Hence, Sabari took the form of a River, which later joined the River Godavari before falling into the sea.

    The Sabari River flowing in the Telangana state is one of the major tributaries of river Godavari. Originating from the western slopes of the Eastern Ghats in Odisha state from the Sinkaram hill ranges at 1370m, it forms a common boundary between Chattisgarh and Odisha and later enters into Telangana to merge with River Godavari.
