<h1><u>History</u></h1>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhadrachalam">
The town has a documented history of a Rama Temple constructed c.â€‰17th century CE by Kancherla Gopanna.[4]

Gopanna (1620 - 1688), popularly known as Bhadradri Ramadasu or Bhadrachala Ramadasu, was a 17th-century Indian devotee of Rama and a composer of Carnatic music. His devotional lyrics to Rama are famous in South Indian classical music as Ramadaasu Keertanalu, and have made Bhadrachalam a place of religious importance for Hindus.[citation needed]

The Bhadrachalam area also has several Hindu temples associated with the epic Ramayana.[5] It is referred as "Dakshina Saketa Puri" in the movie "Sri Ramadasu".
